I'm not far into the game and I guess I could get a hireling.\n\nI like all the other characters but I can't figure out which of them to multiclass as a cleric since they all have low wisdom.\n\nI've decided to forgo magical healing this playthrough and just do an all guy run. Just me, Gale <3, Astarion and Wyll. Idk if it's wise but I simply focus on healing through resting and potions I find.\n\nHopefully I figure out how alchemy works soon so I can create my own healing pots.",

I\u2019ve been purposely avoiding to much so that if I do get it even though I seen whats possible I can go and experience it myself. I don\u2019t want \u201cmeta\u201d builds and this class is the best because of this blah blah. I don\u2019t want to know how to get every companion and where to get them even though I\u2019ve seen the vid recommended. I don\u2019t what to know op weapons or things like that. \n\nI just want to know if I do pick the game up, is it better to do a play through of an original character I make or the dark urge. I\u2019m not interested in playing as the other characters at least not as a first playthrough anyway. However dark urge with being able to be customized seems interesting, however is this better for a potential first play through or should I just do a complete original character first?\n\nAlso how many characters can be made, is there a limit. I\u2019m definitely guessing it will be a big one but not sure if it specifically says or what.\n\nOne last thing is there only physicals released for when there was a digital deluxe edition, so I\u2019m guessing limited.

It\u2019s my first time fighting him and it sounded fun so I wanted to try it out, but every time I get near enough to inflict sunlight sensitivity on him he either heals himself repeatedly(out of combat) or him/his minions sees me and starts combat. I\u2019m playing modded with party limit begone so it\u2019s really a nonissue but I can\u2019t figure out why it\u2019s not working for me. I\u2019ve tried having shadowheart cast daylight both on a character and as a sphere and it just always ends in initiating combat rather than slowing taking away cazador\u2019s health\n\nupdate: \n\nstill can\u2019t figure out why it won\u2019t work, but ended up defeating him in 2 turns by doing the following:\n\n1. placed 4 smoke powder barrels around him, move characters in party towards the edge of either side of the platform\n2. cast daylight sphere and initiate combat\n3. got lucky and my tav (lvl 12 fighter) had a higher initiative than him, used a fire arrow to explode the barrels which took like half his health, then just used all the extra attacks i could and action surge to keep shooting him.\n4. his turn, took radiant damage and he attacked wyll and then wyll took him out with hellish rebuke\n5. defeated his minions and continued the story.

I like the structure with companions only attracted to a specific gender (with some bi romance included however), but I understand why a lot of people prefer the method chosen by Larian for BG3.\n\nAll this to say, I thought a little about what distribution I would have made if I had to write the romances. It's a pure headcanon based on my interpretation of their personalities and backgrounds.

        "content": "I.... Am having a lot of trouble with this one.\n\nI think my party composition is just hard countered. Its my first run so I had no idea about the Myrkul fight or how his abilities worked: unfortunately that means the only bludgeoning weapon in my inventory is the blood of lathander.\n\nMy party is Shart, Karlach, Wyll, and Dark Urge. Dark Urge being a Wizard 1 Bard 7 (all my party is leve 8).\n\nAfter many tries, my strategy is Wyll casting Hunger of Hadar on Myrkul, and Shart holding Melee with Spirit Guardians, but this takes incredibly long to kill it. I dont deal enough damage to it and Nightsong does nothing to it. Karlach deals half damage which means she is on coocoon cleaning duty. Durge does what he can but its not much considering he is a bard, sometimes he throws fireball, he counters Mind Flayer dominate person if needed on the first stage...\n\nAll i can do to cut Myrkuls healing is throw some antiheal arrows at him but its hard to land them and they dont last long.\n\nAm I just fucked?",
