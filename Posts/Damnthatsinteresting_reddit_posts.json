Then the next generation of stars form from those elements, burn, and are again swept out.\nThis constant reprocessing of everything is called galactic chemical evolution. Heavier than lithium elements were made in a star and if you combine those elements in different ways you can make species of gas, minerals, and bigger things like asteroids, and from asteroids, you can start making planets and then you start to make water and other ingredients required for life and then, eventually, us. \nHowever, most of our hydrogen (which makes up roughly 9.5% of our bodies) and lithium, which our body contains in very tiny trace amounts, originated from the Big Bang itself so\u2026 we are roughly 90% star stuff! \nAbout this graphic: This unique original infographic shows the origin of the chemical elements that make up the human body and the systemic function of each.
