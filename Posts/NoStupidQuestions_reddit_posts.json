I always felt like I was missing out on this level of deep conversation in my past relationship. I'm pondering whether this will fizzle out once he gets comfortable, or if he's genuinely interested in exploring different topics.",

I downloaded the Cronometer app to track what I eat everyday accurately by the use of a food scale. I have been going to the gym 3-5 times per week. According to the app, today I have burned 2100 calories (BMR and Exercise included). At the end of the day, i have a 300-400 calories deficit from my daily goal of 2350 calories set my the app. Due to my weight, I can only eat 94g of protein per day. (47kg * 2g/kg) How can I reach that goal in a healthy way? I don\u2019t like to eat fast food or any processed food. I also avoid eating processed sugar. \n\nThanks!",

For a scale I guess it would range from \u201csomeone who never does any religious activities but calls themselves religious\u201d to \u201csomeone who frequently goes to church, prays, and says grace before eating\u201d\n\nThis seems like it would be easy to determine, but to me it\u2019s not. For example, one of my friends wears a necklace with an image of Jesus everyday and has psalms in his social media bios but has an atheist girlfriend and hasn\u2019t gone to church since he was baptized. So while he appears quite devout on the outside, he really isn\u2019t in other ways.\n\nI\u2019m asking this because I\u2019m an agnostic atheist, but I\u2019m interested in asking out a girl who I know is at least somewhat Christian. And I know more devout Christians aren\u2019t willing to be in a relationship with people who aren\u2019t on the same wavelength as them about religion than less devout Christians.",
