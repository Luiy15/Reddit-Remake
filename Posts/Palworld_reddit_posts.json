        "content": "I was looking for the best wood cutter in the game and google reported Wumpo. The problem is Wumpo's are so big I'm not a huge fan of them. The same goes for the Jormuntide for fire tasks. It's just so big that it clutters the base.\n\nWhat do folks think of suggestion to Pocket Pair of adding a passive skill of \"small\" that is the opposite of the \"alpha\" pals. They are smaller so would have a smaller hit box, and maybe less health to balance out that they are harder to hit.\n\nPals with this trait would be easier to use around the base and some might fit through doors easier.  Also, some mounts could fit into dungeons better. They would also make fun \"pets\". I mean who wouldn't like a really tiny Woolipop, Flambelle, or Pengullet following them around? ",

I've gotten a few bosses lately from breeding (they have the boss insignia next to their gender). Seems to be a thing from the last patch.\n\nI'm working on an attack Orserk. So I'm breeding 2 parents, that each have these 4 passives: lucky, musclehead, ferocious, and lord of lightning.\n\nWhat's the percent chance I get a child with all 4 of these parent's passives and the boss insignia? Can anyone answer this question?\n\nSide-note: if you're wondering how I got all these traits --> I caught a lucky relaxasaurus and bred it with a grizzbolt then crossbred that with an orserk caught on pal sanctuary #3. all the orserk's there seem to have lord of lightning. Musclehead and ferocious came through random mutations. \n\nTo dev's of palworld if they're reading it: Frankly its exhausting sourcing all the materials for cakes and then having to sell my insane amount of extra orserks, just to make room in my palbox for new ones, to the black marketer. I went out and captured one just to streamline mass-selling. I've probably bred like 500+ Orserks trying to make the ultimate Orserk and that's just for 1 pal. I'd like to do this with other Pal's but frankly Palworld makes it way too much work. They should consider making it easier some way. ",
